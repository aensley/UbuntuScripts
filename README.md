# UbuntuScripts

Scripts I use on Ubuntu / Debian systems.

## New Machine

First step to perform on a new Ubuntu installation:

```ShellSession
wget -qO- https://ensl.ee/newUbuntu | bash -
```

## Existing Machine

If you have an existing installation and just want the scripts without any installation/removal of software, run this command:

```ShellSession
wget -qO- https://ensl.ee/updateScripts | bash -
```
